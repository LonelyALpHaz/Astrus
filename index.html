                    <hr>
                    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. With a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers, its surface is covered with craters and geological formations similar to the Moon's. The lack of a significant atmosphere causes extreme temperature variations, ranging from 430°C during the day to -180°C at night. Mercury has a slow rotation, with a solar day lasting 176 Earth days and a year of 88 Earth days. Composed mainly of iron, the planet has a large metallic core and a barren surface, making it a subject of interest for studies on the Solar System.</p>

                    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and similar in size to Earth, with a diameter of about 12,104 kilometers. It has a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide and clouds of sulfuric acid, leading to a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in the Solar System, with surface temperatures around 465°C. Venus has a slow rotation, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, while its orbital period is about 225 Earth days. Its surface is rocky and covered by plains, volcanic structures, and mountains, with an atmospheric pressure 92 times that of Earth's.</p>

                    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers and is composed of diverse ecosystems, oceans, and continents. Earth's atmosphere, rich in nitrogen and oxygen, protects the surface from harmful solar radiation and helps regulate the planet's temperature, which averages 15°C. A day lasts 24 hours, and a year is 365.25 days. Earth has a dynamic surface, shaped by tectonic activity, with mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Its abundant liquid water and stable climate make it unique in the Solar System.</p>

                    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and known for its reddish appearance due to iron oxide on its surface. With a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers, it is roughly half the size of Earth. Mars has a thin atmosphere, composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with surface temperatures averaging -60°C. A day on Mars is similar to Earth's, lasting 24.6 hours, while a year is 687 Earth days. The planet features the tallest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and vast canyons. Evidence of past water suggests Mars may have once supported life.</p>

Jupiter's atmosphere features violent storms, including the Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth. It has a rapid rotation, with a day lasting about 10 hours, while its orbital period is 12 Earth years. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and at least 79 moons, including the largest, Ganymede, which is bigger than Mercury.</p>
